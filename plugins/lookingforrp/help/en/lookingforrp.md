# Finding RP
You can find RP in many ways.

* Ask on the RP Requests channel, or respond to requests from others there. Try to keep responses on the channel rather than paging; this helps reduce confusion, especially if someone is using the Discord plugin.
* Sign up for an event.
* Use the Looking for RP flag to set yourself available for RP, or to find others interested in RP.

## Looking for RP
The 'looking for RP' flag is used to indicate that you are actively seeking a distracted or traditionally paced scene. It is not used for those looking for async scenes.

By default, the 'looking for RP' flag expires after one hour. If you know you will be searching for RP longer, you can set it for 2 or 3 hours, after which it will be automatically cleared.

See who is looking for RP on the webportal or by using `who` or `where`.

## Commands
`lookingforrp` - Set yourself as looking for RP.
`lookingforrp <2 or 3>` - Set yourself as looking for RP for a given number of hours.
`lookingforrp/text` - Set yourself as looking for text RP.
`lookingforrp/text <2 or 3>` - Set yourself as looking for text RP for a given number of hours.
`lookingforrp/off` - Turn off your looking for RP flag.
`lookingforrp/announce <on or off>` - Turn off announcements to 'RP Requests' channel when you set your looking for RP flag.
