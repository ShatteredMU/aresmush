# Looking for RP
The 'looking for RP' flag is used to indicate that you are actively seeking a distracted or traditionally paced scene. It is not used for those looking for async scenes.

By default, the 'looking for RP' flag expires after one hour. If you know you will be searching for RP longer, you can set it for 2 or 3 hours, after which point it will be automatically cleared.

See who is looking for RP on the webportal or by using `who` or `where`.

## Commands
`lookingforrp` - Set yourself as looking for RP.
`lookingforrp <2 or 3>` - Set yourself as looking for RP for a given number of hours.
`lookingforrp off` - Turn off your looking for RP flag.
